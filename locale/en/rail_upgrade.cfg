[item-name]
locomotive-light-a=Light weight locomotive
locomotive-light-b=Improved light weight locomotive
locomotive-light-c=Hyper-light locomotive
locomotive-heavy-a=High-speed locomotive
locomotive-heavy-b=Improved high-speed locomotive
locomotive-heavy-c=Hyper-speed locomotive

[item-description]
locomotive-light-a=The reduced weight enabled faster acceleration.
locomotive-light-b=Further improved the structure, reducing the weight to half of the original.
locomotive-light-c=After extreme engine optimization, acceleration has slightly increased.
locomotive-heavy-a=The number of engines was increased to boost max speed and acceleration.
locomotive-heavy-b=Although the weight has increased, the speed has also become significantly faster.
locomotive-heavy-c=Designed for speed, it can run twice as fast as regular trains.
